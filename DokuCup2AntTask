Documentation for the "cup2" Ant Task
=====================================

The "cup2" task allows the user to generate parsers
with Cup2 and to rebuild Cup2 itself.

Usage
=====

You can use the cup2 task inside an Ant target just like
other tasks e.g. javac.

Here is a typical example:
  <cup2 
	cup2specification="edu.tum.cup2.test.SpecCalc4" 
  	SpecSrcDir = "test/edu/tum/cup2/test/"
  	Cup2ClassDirectory="bin/"
  >
	<classpath>
	   		<pathelement path="${build}"/>
	   		<pathelement path="${junit}"/>
	   		<pathelement location="./bin/"/>
	</classpath>
  </cup2>
  
The minimal required attributes are:
- "cup2specification": The specification for the grammar to generate a parser for.
- "SpecSrcDir": The source path to the specification source file.
- "Cup2ClassDirectory":  The directory that contains the class files of Cup2.

Furthermore there is the possibility to set the classpath for compiling the spec
in case there are any additional dependencies.
	      
Here is a second example with all possible attributes:
  <cup2 
	cup2specification="edu.tum.cup2.test.SpecCalc4" 
    specsrcdir = "C:/praktikum_cup/workspace/CUP2/test/edu/tum/cup2/test/"
    cup2classdirectory="C:/praktikum_cup/workspace/CUP2/bin" 
    Cup2SourcePath = "C:/praktikum_cup/workspace/CUP2/src"
    specdestdir = "C:/praktikum_cup/workspace/CUP2/specdestdir"
    cup2file = "C:/praktikum_cup/workspace/CUP2/cup2filefromant.cup2"
    algorithm = "LR1"
    verbose = "true"
    printparsingtable = "C:/praktikum_cup/workspace/CUP2/printparsingtable.html"
   >
	<classpath>
	   		<pathelement path="${build}"/>
	   		<pathelement path="${junit}"/>
	   		<pathelement location="./test/"/>
	</classpath>
  </cup2>
      
"Cup2SourcePath": when specified, also (re-)compile Cup2
"SpecDestDir": path where to store the spec's class file
"Cup2File": file where to store the serialized parser
"Algorithm": This attribute allows you to choose a certain parsing algorithm. 
			 Possible values: "lr1"|"lr0"|"lalr1"
"Verbose": Possible values: "on"|"off"
           When set to "on" more information is displayed in the Console.
"PrintParsingTable": file where to print the parsing table (for debug purposes)

Ant taksdef for the "cup2" task
===============================

When using the new "cup2" Ant task in your Ant script,
the task has to be defined.
There you can insert a taskdef tag in your script.

Example for a taskdef for the cup2 task:

<taskdef name="cup2" 
	classname="edu.tum.cup2.ant.Cup2AntTask" 
	classpath="bin" />

Inserting the taskdef in the beginning of your Ant project,
makes the cup2 task usable in the project.
The taskdef attribute "classname" points to the implementing
class of the Ant task. In this case it is always "edu.tum.cup2.ant.Cup2AntTask".
The "classpath" attribute contains the (relative) path to the class file
for the implementing class.

Ant library
===========

In order to compile the Ant task for cup2 (edu.tum.cup2.ant.Cup2AntTask),
the "ant.jar" has to be in the java build path.
Remark: ant.jar has also been added to the cup2 svn repository.
